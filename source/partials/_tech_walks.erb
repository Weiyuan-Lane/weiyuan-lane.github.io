  <h1>ðŸ‘£ tech walks</h1>
  <p>I initially started <a class="button" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=techwalks">&#35;TechWalks</a> in Singapore, as a way of contributing back to the community - at a time of online negativity and frustration of restricted at home due to the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>
  <p>The premise was simple, walk (exercise) responsibly and talk along the way, with food as a bonus component ðŸ˜‹. Walking has become more successful than having a meal, where topics would flow more organically from engineering to mentoring.</p>
  <p>And you feel rewarded not just from learning from one other, but also from the physical workout!</p>
